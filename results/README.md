# Results

Each run writes `results/<time>_<name>_<config hash>/` with `manifest.json`,
`metrics.json` and `forecasts.csv`. Run folders are not committed.

A run that is quoted in the paper is copied to `results/promoted/` (manifest
and metrics only) and committed, so every number in the paper points to a
manifest in git.

## M5 benchmarks

WRMSSE over the 12 levels of the M5 hierarchy. Lower is better. Each row
links to a folder in `results/promoted/` holding its manifest and scores.

| Method | 25 Apr to 22 May 2016 | 23 May to 19 Jun 2016 (official test period) |
|---|---|---|
| Seasonal naive | 0.870 | 0.847 |
| LightGBM, one model per store | 0.715 | 0.552 |

Published scores on the official test period, from the organisers' files
(`data/raw/m5_reference/`): seasonal naive 0.847, best statistical benchmark
(exponential smoothing, bottom-up) 0.671, 50th-ranked entry 0.576,
10th-ranked entry 0.547, winning entry 0.520.

Notes:

- The LightGBM settings were fixed before the test-period run and were not
  tuned on either window.
- In the April to May window the LightGBM forecasts are 7.7% below actual
  sales in total. In the test period they are 2.1% below.
